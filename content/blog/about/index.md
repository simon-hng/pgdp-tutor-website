# Hello world,

Hello future TUM informatics students (and others, _yes, even you TUM-BWLers_).

First of all I would like to welcome you all to this _excellent_ University of ours.
You obviously made an excellent choice and if you get your degree
you shouldn't have any troubles earning a comfortable living wage.

Unfortunately you started your studies during the ongoing Corona pandemic
and therefore will experience a different kind of student-life as you might have expected.
Since you cannot profit from the productive and studious environment that the campus can offer you,
I decided to try my best and help as much as I can with your studies.

## I made this to help you with your studies online

During my work as tutor for the "vorkurs" as well as "PGDP"
I will try to upload a post for each tutor session,
so that (if you are like me and fall asleep during online meetings),
you can still follow along and learn for yourself with your own pace.

## Notes

1. I promise that upcoming posts won't be as ugly as I will write a lot more code and less prose.
1. Sorry for bad spelling but I am using vim and don't have a spellcheck plugin yet

Hope to see you all soon and have fun stu**dying** :)
